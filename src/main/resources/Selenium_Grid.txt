Running Selenium Grid
Docker Users:

I would suggest you to use docker for selenium grid if possible.

Save this content in a file called - docker-compse.yaml

version: "3"
services:
  hub:
    image: selenium/hub:3.14
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"
  chrome:
    image: selenium/node-chrome:3.14      
    depends_on:
      - hub
    environment:
      - HUB_HOST=hub
  firefox:
    image: selenium/node-firefox:3.14
    shm_size: '1gb'   
    depends_on:
      - hub
    environment:
      - HUB_HOST=hub
Issue docker-compose up command to bring up selenium grid & docker-compose down for bringing it down.

Non-docker Users:

Download this jar and move it to a separate directory called 'grid'.

Open 2 terminal/command line windows

Navigate to the 'gird' directory.

Issue this command in the first terminal/command line window.

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub

You would see a message - ' Selenium Grid hub is up and running' in few seconds

Issue this command in the second terminal / command line. Update the chrome driver path before running the command.

java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/of/the/chromedriver -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

You should see this message - 'The node is registered to the hub and ready to use'

You can access your grid in your browser.

http://localhost:4444/grid/console

Please do note that WebDriver will be using http://localhost:4444/wd/hub as the grid URL.
